- Open the folder where you saved the code.
- [Install Wrangler if you haven't done that yet](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/).
- Install dependencies with `npm install`
- Set your Gemini API key as a secret: `npx wrangler secret put GEMINI_API_KEY` (paste your API key when prompted)
  - For local development, you can also create a `.dev.vars` file with: `GEMINI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here`
- Run the code with `npx wrangler dev`.
- Open the URL in your browser.
